What exactly are we planning? A lot of that is a surprise for the future, but let us explain as much as we can about this teaching studio we need help starting.

Teaching can be very difficult to start, and especially during college. The space and the tools needed to teach can also be hard to come by as well. We're here to solve these problems for college music students to help kickstart them (if you will).

Starting to take private lessons can be confusing, expensive, and difficult. It's hard to know who to go to, how much you should be paying at what age, and sometimes even difficult to pick what to take lessons in.

We're here to help both those wanting to take lessons, and those who want to teach them. We found the perfect place that we want to rent right across the street from Frasier Hall on UNC's campus (921 16th St.) that will only need minimal construction to serve as the perfect center of communication. This will help keep teachers and students stay connected and all have a single place to go to. We our going to offer as many different services as we can so that anyone wanting to learn can come to our studio and find the teacher they need. This includes services you may not have thought of, like Vocal Jazz lessons, Theory Tutoring, and Composition. 

One of the other comments I've heard when a parents want their kid to start taking lessons, is that they're worried that student teachers may not give the quality of education their kid needs at that age. This is why our connection with UNC is so important. We are formed from the UNC music student body, and are thus connected to all the great faculty there. While we are still learning ourselves, we have the perfect situation for improvement. Any questions teachers have, and problems that may arise we can bring to the exceptional faculty at UNC.

This perfect environment for learning involves people all through Greeley, making the already great community of Greeley even better, while improving the music and teaching of all involved.

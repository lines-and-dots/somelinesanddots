Hi! My name is Nectaria Delgadillo, but my students call me Nicky. My first cello teacher (who was a student herself), pulled me from an out of tune "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" to a comfy spot in the nationally renowned Phoenix Youth Symphony and the Arizona All State Orchestra. I fell in love with the passionate sounds of the cello,and as I pursue my music career at UNC, I would like to be that teacher who inspires and guides other young musicians. I am currently studying under the bow of Dr. Gal Faganel and am sitting 2nd chair in the UNC Orchestra. I have been giving instruction for several years, creatively focusing on the foundation of building strong technique.

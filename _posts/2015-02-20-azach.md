My name is Zach Berglund, and I am the owner of Lines and Dots. I am a composer, trumpet player, and piano player wanting to share my knowledge with others. I started learning music (originally on trumpet) twelve years ago and I quickly became very passionate about it. I have had a few years of past experience teaching music privately, and a few years off to work on improving. I have played in honor bands, composed for a few short videos, and am currently halfway through my junior year of acquiring a Bachelor of Arts in composition at UNC. I am pursuing a career composing for video games, but I also desire to enrich othersâ€™ lives by sharing and passing on my love of music.

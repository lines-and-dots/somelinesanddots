My name is Nathalie Krainock. I am a harpist that also has a passion for theory and piano. I started playing the piano fifteen years ago then started playing the harp eleven years ago. I have had experience as a performer for the majority of my life at venues such as business meetings, weddings, and Christmas Mass, and I love to play music and share my musical talents with others. I am currently in my junior year achieving a Bachelor of Arts in Music at the University of Northern Colorado, and I love spreading my musical knowledge with others so that they too can share music.

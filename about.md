# What Is Lines and Dots

Lines and Dots are a part of everything we see. They are the pieces that structural all of the world around us. They have such an extremely important role, and yet, they are not often thought about. Lines and Dots serve as our example to explain our goal: **To bring appreciation to that which might not have been appreciated.**
	
## What We Do

We do a lot, and we hope to only do more. We started as a few musicians who had a passion for appreciating art, and so it was only fitting that we start in music. Our first of many endeavors is opening a <a href="/studio">teaching studio</a> in Greeley, Colorado (our hometown) creating a single location to help fill all your music-learning needs, while simultaneously making a safe and exciting environment for both students wanting to learn more about music, and musicians to learn how to better teach. This is only the beginning, however, and we will constantly be finding ways to bring more appreciation to art, and people.

If you want to see all that is going on in Lines and Dots, check out our <a href="/home">home</a>. While we are still in the midst of building it, in the future there will be a <a href="/people">blog</a> that will be all about people doing great things. And if you have ideas you would like to share, or would like to talk, <a href="/contact">contact us</a>!
